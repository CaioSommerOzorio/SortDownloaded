# SortDownloaded
A python script to run in the background that automatically sorts downloaded files in their respective folders.

# Configuration
Because it's an application that runs in the background, I chose the sleep time to be 5 seconds so it's not repeatedly running. You can configure this.
The path of which the files will get sent to will be have to be modified.

# To do

- Open to suggestions

# Requirements
`pip3 install colorama`
